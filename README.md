# Web Application Assignment 1
## Limerick Animal Welfare - A Charity Website

For my submission, I decided to take a charity which I care about and improve their existing website. [http://www.limerickanimalwelfare.ie/](Limerick Animal Welfare) are a no-kill animal shelter, located approximately 30 miles from Limerick City. In addition to their animal rescue, they promote the humane treatment of animals throughout society.

Throughout my submission, I've endeavoured to seperate content and styling by using appropriate, valid HTML and CSS. In particular the assignment requested the use of the following:

- Links to both my own pages and external webpages

My navigation bar (e.g. index.html lines 13-24) includes links to both my own pages, as well as external sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Google Maps.
