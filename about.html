            <p>Limerick Animal Welfare is a registered charity, founded in 1983, dedicated to caring for abandoned and neglected animals in the Limerick area. Over the last five years alone we have saved more than 2000 animals. We aim to promote the humane treatment of all animals, working towards a more compassionate society. We believe in educating young people about responsible pet ownership.</p>

            <p>We regularly give talks to primary and secondary schools. In this way we hope to educate and inform the animal owners of tomorrow and encourage them to make kindness and respect for all animals a way of life. We aim never to destroy an animal unless it is so ill that we cannot alleviate its suffering. It is our policy to spay/neuter all dogs and cats before rehoming. At any one time we care for approximately 60 dogs and 30 cats. Phase One of our Sanctuary at Moorestown, Kilfinane, was finally completed in December 2007. Our first isolation kennel for dogs opened its doors to the abandoned animals just before Christmas. We are most grateful to all the generous animal lovers who donated funds for this wonderful building. The Sanctuary now provides shelter for up to sixty dogs and puppies, fifty cats and kittens, numerous rabbits, goats, pigs, horses, ponies and donkeys.</p>
